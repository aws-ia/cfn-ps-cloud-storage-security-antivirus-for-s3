=== Specialized knowledge

Partner Solution deployments require a moderate level of familiarity with AWS services. If you're new to AWS, refer to https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/[Getting Started Resource Center^] and https://aws.amazon.com/training/[AWS Training and Certification^]. These sites provide materials for learning how to design, deploy, and operate your infrastructure and applications on AWS.

=== AWS account

If you don't have an AWS account, create one at https://aws.amazon.com/[https://aws.amazon.com^] by following the on-screen instructions. Part of the sign-up process involves receiving a phone call and entering a PIN.

Your AWS account is automatically signed up for all AWS services. You are charged only for the services you use.

==== Supported AWS Regions

Partner Solution deployments includes services which aren't necessarily supported in all https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/[AWS Regions^]. When deploying a Partner Solution, review the services that are deployed and ensure the Region in which you are deploying supports all of these services.

TIP: Certain Regions are available on an opt-in basis. For more information, refer to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande-manage.html[Managing AWS Regions^].

==== Amazon EC2 key pairs

Some Partner Solutions deploy Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances. If the Partner Solution you launch includes one or more EC2 instances, ensure that at least one https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html[Amazon EC2 key pair^] exists in your AWS account in the Region in which you plan to deploy the Partner Solution. Note the key-pair name because you will use it during deployment. To create a key pair, refer to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html[Amazon EC2 key pairs and Linux instances^].

For testing or proof-of-concept purposes, we recommend creating a new key pair instead of using one that's already being used by a production instance.

==== IAM permissions
Before launching this Partner Solution, you must sign in to the AWS Management Console with IAM permissions for the resources that the templates deploy. The _AdministratorAccess_ managed policy within IAM provides sufficient permissions, although your organization may choose to use a custom policy with more restrictions. For more information, refer to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_job-functions.html[AWS managed policies for job functions^].
