== Postdeployment steps

=== {partner-product-short-name} console
After deployment, check the administrator email account for a message from `Antivirus for Amazon S3â€”Console Account Information`. It contains a link to the {partner-product-short-name} console and temporary login credentials.

Choose the link to the {partner-product-short-name} console in the email message and log in using the temporary credentials. After logging in, change your password as prompted and make changes to your console configuration as necessary.

=== Transfer Family server
If you selected to deploy a Transfer Family server during deployment, sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/transfer#/[AWS Transfer Family console^]. Review the default settings for the server deployed by the solution. Note the following:

* The server uses SFTP (Secure Shell File Transfer Protocol).
* The server has a public endpoint.
* The deployment creates a Lambda function to validate authentication for secure file transfers.
* The solution uploads files directly to S3 directly and invokes an event-based scan by Antivirus for Managed File Transfers.
* To connect to the server, use the same username and password configured in the Antivirus for Managed File Transfers console.
